  <font size="50">Now that we are on Quarinteen, What can we do with all of our new free time?</font></center>
  </h1>
  <p>
    1)      The first thing that I believe people should do during this free time is take the time to bond with others around you. If you live with your family enjoy time with them during these challenging times in our society. Having fun with you family is just what you need during these times
    <br><br>
    2)      The second thing you can do is take a walk outside. Walking can improve your mood and your health and I reccomend taking a walk every day. Make sure that you are avoiding contact with other people and a walk would be very benifitial.
    <br><br>
    3)      Another way to spend your time is to watch TV and check the news in order to understand the whole corona situation better. Educating yourself about new found treatments or just informing yourself about things going on in the world can be a good thing
    <br><br>
    4)      Setting a goal for yourself like doing one hundred push-ups everyday are a great way to stay determined while also making you stronger and overall healthier.
    <br><br> 
    5)      Talk with people using a phone. Communication with others is very fun and this will allow you to relate with someone else who shares common intrests with you.
    <br><br>
    6)      Sit down and read a book. Books have been read for generations and sitting down to read a book can be both fun and useful in educating your brain during a time where you will not really use it.
    <br><br>
    7)      Learn to speak another language(code/real language). Learning new things when you have free time will make the time that you do not have freetime more easy to get through. If you are taking a spanish class take this time to get ahead of the game. If you are taking a computer science class take this time to get ahead of the game
    <br><br>
    8)      Finally I reccomend enjoying the people around you as many people are endangered by this virus and you should take the time to appreciate everyone around you and enjoy their company.

  <font size="50">What am I doing with my newly found time?</font>

  <p>
    <img src="http://clipart-library.com/images/6cpo8geoi.png">
  </center><br>                Firstly, I am doing a lot of home workouts now because of all the gyms closing. I enjoy working out and with all of the gyms closing I needed to adapt and begin working out at home because everything is closed. I do workouts at parks and in my own home. I focus on body weight exercises and although this is more challenging it is something that I need to do. I enjoy working out and it helps release stress and I will continue to do this during the corona break.
  <br><br><br><br>
  <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Netflix_icon.svg/480px-Netflix_icon.svg.png"></center>
<br> Another thing that I am doing with my new found time is watching shows on netflix that I was previously unavailable to watch because of my focus on school. School is a priority and because school work is kept at a minimum I can spend time watching shows that I was previously unable to enjoy because of school. Now I can really work on this and I actually enjoy watching new shows.
<br><br><br><br>

</center><br>
During this new found time due to the corona virus I can spend more time with my family which allows me to really bond with them. It is can be fun and I enjyo spending time with them. With school I am far to busy to really hangout with my family everyday and because I do not have school I can spend my time with my family instead of studying for tests everyday. This new time is really great and I enjoy having the ability to spend time with my family during this new time period.

<br>
Video games are something that I enjoy doing. I play video games fairly often and my favorite game is GTA5. During this break I will play GTA5 and many other games because of all the freetime I have. It is something that is fun to do and enjoyable. In the future I will play other video games, however, for now GTA5 is fun and their is no need for me to play any other games.

  <img src="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Logo-TikTok-500x281.jpg"></center><br>
Tik tok is an app that I first downloaded as a joke, however, after watching a few videos I can safely say im hooked. This app has funny videos and is sort of addicting. It is great to watch when you need a laugh and because of how challenging these few weeks have been it is nice to have something funny to watch. I enjoy the app and would highly reccomend it to others. For this break caused by corona I will continue to watch tiktoks and I think it is fun.
<br><br><br><br><center><img src="https://fivechannels.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Eight-Best-Types-of-Social-Media-for-Advertising-1.jpg"></center><br>
The final thing that I will do over this long break caused by corona is use social media to communicate with other people who I can not hang out with because of the virus. I enjoy using snapchat for messaging people and I think that social media in general is something that is very important for me to use because I think that in these dark times it is important to communicate. I will continue to communicate with others during these dark times and I believe that these apps allow me to communicate<br><br><br>

  <font size="50">If school is to be shutdown</font>
  </h1></center><p>
   If school were to be shut down for the rest of the year this would be ok with me. I believe stopping the spread of the virus is what is important. To make sure I do well in school I will most likely learn to take advantage of the time we have in zoom and I will also make sure I pay attention more. With no one to ask questions to I think that the school year will be much more difficult if it is kept online. To prepare for this I have been practicing learning topics without the help of the teacher but instead with the help of google. This has been very useful and I believe it will come in handy during these dark corona times.

  <font size="50">My thoughts on the Virus</font>
  </h1></center><p>Personally I believe that the Corona virus itself is something that although seems like it is blown out of proportions it is not. The virus is world wide now effecting almost all countries around the world. Many countries have declared national emergencies causing entire countries to be shut down. I believe that this virus is a real issue and hopefully it is cured or a vaccine is created. Something can not be blown out of proportions when most of the world has declared emergencies and going outside is not limited. This virus is not a joke, but instead something that could kill millions.</p>
