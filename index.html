  <font size="50">Now that we are on Quarinteen, What can we do with all of our new free time?</font></center>
  </h1>
  <p>
    1)      The first thing that I believe people should do during this free time is take the time to bond with others around you. If you live with your family enjoy time with them during these challenging times in our society. Having fun with you family is just what you need during these times
    <br><br>
    2)      The second thing you can do is take a walk outside. Walking can improve your mood and your health and I reccomend taking a walk every day. Make sure that you are avoiding contact with other people and a walk would be very benifitial.
    <br><br>
    3)      Another way to spend your time is to watch TV and check the news in order to understand the whole corona situation better. Educating yourself about new found treatments or just informing yourself about things going on in the world can be a good thing
    <br><br>
    4)      Setting a goal for yourself like doing one hundred push-ups everyday are a great way to stay determined while also making you stronger and overall healthier.
    <br><br> 
    5)      Talk with people using a phone. Communication with others is very fun and this will allow you to relate with someone else who shares common intrests with you.
    <br><br>
    6)      Sit down and read a book. Books have been read for generations and sitting down to read a book can be both fun and useful in educating your brain during a time where you will not really use it.
    <br><br>
    7)      Learn to speak another language(code/real language). Learning new things when you have free time will make the time that you do not have freetime more easy to get through. If you are taking a spanish class take this time to get ahead of the game. If you are taking a computer science class take this time to get ahead of the game
    <br><br>
    8)      Finally I reccomend enjoying the people around you as many people are endangered by this virus and you should take the time to appreciate everyone around you and enjoy their company.
